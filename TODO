reports
periodic event cancellation, and maybe better view for one time reservations

WONT-FIXes:
- proper classes https://developer.gnome.org/gtk-tutorial/stable/x2200.html
- faster enlarge_table algorithm
- faster search
- translation via gettext
- handle corrupted files safely
- full text search or property search

Pre-release checklist:
[ ] GTK+ 3.20 -> 3.18
[ ] widgets in forms have hexpand/vexpand
[ ] ensure all headers have pragma once
[ ] ensure all files have a signature
[ ] static functions everywhere
[ ] comments end with a dot
[ ] free and unref
[ ] formatting
[ ] Ubuntu 16.04 compilation without warnings (https://stackoverflow.com/q/29883211)
